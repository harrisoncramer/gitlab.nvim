OVERVIEW                                                *gitlab.nvim.overview*

This Neovim plugin is designed to make it easy to review Gitlab MRs from within
the editor. This means you can do things like:

- Create, approve, and merge MRs for the current branch
- Read and edit an MR description
- Add or remove reviewers and assignees
- Resolve, reply to, and unresolve discussion threads
- Create, edit, delete, and reply to comments
- View and manage pipeline Jobs
- Upload files, jump to the browser, and a lot more!


REQUIREMENTS                                        *gitlab.nvim.requirements*

- Go >= v1.19


QUICK START                                          *gitlab.nvim.quick-start*

1. Install Go
2. Add configuration (see Installation section)
5. Run `:lua require("gitlab").choose_merge_request()`

This will checkout the branch locally, and up the plugin's reviewer pane.


INSTALLATION                                        *gitlab.nvim.installation*

With Lazy:
>lua
    return {
      "harrisoncramer/gitlab.nvim",
      dependencies = {
        "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
        "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
        "sindrets/diffview.nvim",
        "stevearc/dressing.nvim", -- Recommended but not required. Better UI for pickers.
        "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons" -- Recommended but not required. Icons in discussion tree.
      },
      enabled = true,
      build = function () require("gitlab.server").build(true) end, -- Builds the Go binary
      config = function()
        require("gitlab").setup()
      end,
    }
<
And with Packer:
>lua
  use {
    "harrisoncramer/gitlab.nvim",
    requires = {
      "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
      "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
      "sindrets/diffview.nvim"
      "stevearc/dressing.nvim", -- Recommended but not required. Better UI for pickers.
      "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons", -- Recommended but not required. Icons in discussion tree.
    },
    build = function()
      require("gitlab.server").build()
    end,
    branch = "develop",
    config = function()
      require("diffview") -- We require some global state from diffview
      local gitlab = require("gitlab")
      gitlab.setup()
    end,
  }
<

CONNECTING TO GITLAB                        *gitlab.nvim.connecting-to-gitlab*

This plugin requires an auth token to connect to Gitlab. The token can be set
in the root directory of the project in a `.gitlab.nvim` environment file, or
can be set via a shell environment variable called `GITLAB_TOKEN` instead. If
both are present, the `.gitlab.nvim` file will take precedence.

Optionally provide a GITLAB_URL environment variable (or gitlab_url value in
the `.gitlab.nvim` file) to connect to a self-hosted Gitlab instance. This is
optional, use ONLY for self-hosted instances. Here’s what they’d look like
as environment variables:
>bash
    export GITLAB_TOKEN="your_gitlab_token"
    export GITLAB_URL="https://my-personal-gitlab-instance.com/"
<
And as a `.gitlab.nvim` file:
>
    auth_token=your_gitlab_token
    gitlab_url=https://my-personal-gitlab-instance.com/
<
The plugin will look for the `.gitlab.nvim` file in the root of the current
project by default. However, you may provide a custom path to the configuration
file via the `config_path` option. This must be an absolute path to the
directory that holds your `.gitlab.nvim` file.

The `connection_settings` block in the `state.lua` file will be used to
configure your connection to Gitlab.

In case even more control over the auth config is needed, there is the
possibility to override the `auth_provider` settings field. It should be
a function that returns the `token` as well as the `gitlab_url` value and
a nilable error value.

If the `gitlab_url` is `nil`, `https://gitlab.com` is used as default.

Here an example how to use a custom `auth_provider`:
>lua
    require("gitlab").setup({
      auth_provider = function()
        return "my_token", "https://custom.gitlab.instance.url", nil
      end,
    }
<


CONFIGURING THE PLUGIN                    *gitlab.nvim.configuring-the-plugin*

Here is the default setup function. All of these values are optional, and if
you call this function with no values the defaults will be used:

USAGE                                                      *gitlab.nvim.usage*

First, check out the branch that you want to review locally:
>
    git checkout feature-branch
<
Then open Neovim. To begin, try running the `summary` command or the `review`
command.


THE SUMMARY VIEW                                *gitlab.nvim.the-summary-view*

The `summary` action will open the MR title and description:
>lua
    require("gitlab").summary()
<
After editing the description or title, you may save your changes via the
`settings.popup.perform_action` keybinding.

By default this plugin will also show additional metadata about the MR in a
separate pane underneath the description. This can be disabled, and these
fields can be reordered or removed. Please see the `settings.info` section of
the configuration.


REVIEWING AN MR                                  *gitlab.nvim.reviewing-an-mr*

The `review` action will open a diff of the changes. You can leave comments
using the `create_comment` action. In visual mode, add multiline comments with
the `create_multiline_comment` command, and add suggested changes with the
`create_comment_suggestion` command:
>lua
    require("gitlab").review()
    require("gitlab").create_comment()
    require("gitlab").create_multiline_comment()
    require("gitlab").create_comment_suggestion()
<
For suggesting changes you can use `create_comment_suggestion` in visual mode
which works similar to `create_multiline_comment` but prefills the comment
window with Gitlab’s suggest changes
<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/reviews/suggestions.html>
code block with prefilled code from the visual selection.
Just like the summary, all the different kinds of comments are saved via the
`settings.popup.perform_action` keybinding.

DRAFT NOTES                                       *gitlab.nvim.draft-comments*

When you publish a "draft" of any of the above resources, the comment will be
added to a review. You can configure the default commenting mode (draft vs
live) via the `state.settings.discussion_tree.draft_mode` setting, and you can
toggle the setting with the `state.settings.discussion_tree.toggle_draft_mode`
keybinding, or by calling the `gitlab.toggle_draft_mode()` function. You may
publish all draft comments via the `gitlab.publish_all_drafts()` function, and
you can publish an individual comment or note by pressing the
`state.settings.discussion_tree.publish_draft` keybinding.

Draft notes do not support replying or emojis.

TEMPORARY REGISTERS                               *gitlab.nvim.temp-registers*

While writing a note/comment/suggestion/reply, you may need to interrupt the
work, do something else (e.g., read something in another file, etc.), and then
get back to your work on the comment. For occasions like this, you can set
`settings.popup.temp_registers` to a list of writable registers (see |registers|)
to which the contents of the popup window will be saved just before quitting.

A possible setting is, e.g., `settings.popup.temp_registers = {'"', "+", "g"}`
which saves to the so called unnamed register (see |quotequote|), the system
clipboard register (see |quoteplus|), as well as to the "g" register. This lets
you easily paste the text back in with |p| or |P| (from the unnamed register),
or with `"gp` or `"gP` if the unnamed register gets overwritten with something
else. Using the clipboard register lets you easily use the text outside of
nvim.

NOTE: The `temp_registers` are also filled with the contents of the popup when
pressing the `settings.popup.perform_action` keybinding, even if the action
that was supposed to be performed fails.

DISCUSSIONS AND NOTES                      *gitlab.nvim.discussions-and-notes*

Gitlab groups threads of comments together into "discussions."

To display all discussions for the current MR, use the `toggle_discussions`
action, which will show the discussions in a split window:
>lua
    require("gitlab").toggle_discussions()
<

You can jump to the comment’s location in the reviewer window by using the
`state.settings.discussion_tree.jump_to_reviewer` key, or to the actual file
with the `state.settings.discussion_tree.jump_to_file` key.

Within the discussion tree, you can delete/edit/reply to comments with the
`state.settings.discussion_tree.SOME_ACTION` keybindings.

If you’d like to create a note in an MR (like a comment, but not linked to a
specific line) use the `create_note` action. The same keybindings for
delete/edit/reply are available on the note tree.
>lua
    require("gitlab").create_note()
<

When the 'wrap' option is on, line wrapping can make the discussion tree
harder to read. You can use the 'breakindent' option to visually indent tree
nodes at the same level. If you don't want to set 'breakindent' globally, you
can set this only for the `gitlab` file type (the file type of discussions and
notes). One way of doing this is by creating a file called
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/after/ftplugin/gitlab.lua with the following contents:
>lua
    vim.o.breakindent = true
<

LABELS                                                    *gitlab.nvim.labels*

You can add or remove labels from the current MR.
>lua
    require("gitlab").add_label()
    require("gitlab").delete_label()

These labels will be visible in the summary panel, as long as you provide the
"fields" string in your setup function under the `setting.info.fields` block.


SIGNS AND DIAGNOSTICS                      *gitlab.nvim.signs-and-diagnostics*

By default when reviewing files, you will see diagnostics for comments that
have been added to a review. These are the default settings:
>lua
  discussion_signs = {
    enabled = true, -- Show diagnostics for gitlab comments in the reviewer
    skip_resolved_discussion = false, -- Show diagnostics for resolved discussions
    severity = vim.diagnostic.severity.INFO, -- ERROR, WARN, INFO, or HINT
    virtual_text = false, -- Whether to show the comment text inline as floating virtual text
    priority = 100, -- Higher will override LSP warnings, etc
    icons = {
      comment = "→|",
      range = " |",
    },
  },

When the cursor is on diagnostic line you can view discussion thread by using `vim.diagnostic.show()`

You can also jump to discussion tree for the given comment:
>lua
    require("gitlab").move_to_discussion_tree_from_diagnostic()

You may skip resolved discussions by toggling `discussion_signs.skip_resolved_discussion`
in your setup function to true. By default, discussions from this plugin
are shown at the INFO severity level (see :h vim.diagnostic.severity).


EMOJIS                                                    *gitlab.nvim.emojis*

You can add or remove emojis from a note or comment in the discussion tree.

To see who has reacted with an emoji, hover over the emoji. A popup will
appear with anyone who has responded with that emoji. You can only delete
emojis that you have responded with.


UPLOADING FILES                                  *gitlab.nvim.uploading-files*

To attach a file to an MR description, reply, comment, and so forth use the
`settings.popup.perform_linewise_action` keybinding when the popup is open.
This will open a picker that will look for files in the directory you specify
in the `settings.attachment_dir` folder (this must be an absolute path).

When you have picked the file, it will be added to the current buffer at the
current line.

Use the `settings.popup.perform_action` to send the changes to Gitlab.


MR APPROVALS                                        *gitlab.nvim.mr-approvals*

You can approve or revoke approval for an MR with the `approve` and `revoke`
actions respectively:
>lua
    require("gitlab").approve()
    require("gitlab").revoke()
<

MERGING AN MR                                      *gitlab.nvim.merging-an-mr*

The `merge` action will merge an MR. The MR must be in a "mergeable" state for
this command to work.
>lua
    require("gitlab").merge()
    require("gitlab").merge({ squash = false, delete_branch = false })
<
See |gitlab.nvim.merge| for more help on this function.


CREATING AN MR                                    *gitlab.nvim.creating-an-mr*

To create an MR for the current branch, make sure you have the branch checked
out. Then, use the `create_mr` action. See |gitlab.nvim.create_mr| for more
help on this function
>lua
    require("gitlab").create_mr()
    require("gitlab").create_mr({ target = "main" })
    require("gitlab").create_mr({ template_file = "my-template.md", title = "Fix bug XYZ" })
<

PIPELINES                                              *gitlab.nvim.pipelines*

You can view the status of the pipeline for the current MR with the `pipeline`
action.
>lua
    require("gitlab").pipeline()
<
To re-trigger failed jobs in the pipeline manually, use the
`settings.popup.perform_action` keybinding. To open the log trace of a job in a
new Neovim buffer, use your `settings.popup.perform_linewise_action`
keybinding.


REVIEWERS AND ASSIGNEES                  *gitlab.nvim.reviewers-and-assignees*

The `add_reviewer` and `delete_reviewer` actions, as well as the `add_assignee`
and `delete_assignee` functions, will let you choose from a list of users who
are available in the current project:
>lua
    require("gitlab").add_reviewer()
    require("gitlab").delete_reviewer()
    require("gitlab").add_assignee()
    require("gitlab").delete_assignee()
<
These actions use Neovim’s built in picker, which is much nicer if you
install `dressing.nvim`. If you use Dressing, please enable it:
>lua
    require("dressing").setup({
        input = {
            enabled = true
        }
    })
<

RESTARTING OR SHUTTING DOWN          *gitlab.nvim.restarting-or-shutting-down*

The `gitlab.nvim` server will shut down automatically when you exit Neovim.
However, if you would like to manage this yourself (for instance, restart the
server when you check out a new branch) you may do so via the `restart`
command, or `shutdown` commands, which both accept callbacks:
>lua
    require("gitlab.server").restart()
    require("gitlab.server").shutdown()
<
For instance you could set up the following keybinding to close and reopen the
reviewer when checking out a new branch:
>lua
    local gitlab = require("gitlab")
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glB", function ()
        require("gitlab.server").restart(function ()
            vim.cmd.tabclose()
            gitlab.review() -- Reopen the reviewer after the server restarts
        end)
    end)
<

KEYBINDINGS                                          *gitlab.nvim.keybindings*

The plugin does not set up any keybindings outside of the special buffers it
creates, you need to set them up yourself. Here’s what I’m using (note that
the `<leader>` prefix is not necessary, as `gl` does not have a special meaning
in normal mode):
>lua
    local gitlab = require("gitlab")
    local gitlab_server = require("gitlab.server")
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glr", gitlab.review)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "gls", gitlab.summary)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glA", gitlab.approve)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glR", gitlab.revoke)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glc", gitlab.create_comment)
    vim.keymap.set("v", "glc", gitlab.create_multiline_comment)
    vim.keymap.set("v", "glC", gitlab.create_comment_suggestion)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glO", gitlab.create_mr)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glm", gitlab.move_to_discussion_tree_from_diagnostic)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "gln", gitlab.create_note)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "gld", gitlab.toggle_discussions)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glaa", gitlab.add_assignee)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glad", gitlab.delete_assignee)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glra", gitlab.add_reviewer)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glrd", gitlab.delete_reviewer)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glp", gitlab.pipeline)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glo", gitlab.open_in_browser)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glM", gitlab.merge)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glu", gitlab.copy_mr_url)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glP", gitlab.publish_all_drafts)
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glD", gitlab.toggle_draft_mode)

TROUBLESHOOTING                                  *gitlab.nvim.troubleshooting*

To check that the current settings of the plugin are configured correctly,~
please run:~
>lua
    require("gitlab").print_settings()
<
This plugin uses a Go server to reach out to Gitlab. It’s possible that
something is going wrong when starting that server or connecting with Gitlab.
The Go server runs outside of Neovim, and can be interacted with directly in
order to troubleshoot. To start the server, check out your feature branch and
run these commands:
>lua
    require("gitlab.server").build(true)
    require("gitlab.server").start(function() print("Server started") end)
<

The easiest way to debug what’s going wrong is to turn on the `debug` options
in your setup function. This will allow you to see requests leaving the Go
server, and the responses coming back from Gitlab. Once the server is running,
you can also interact with the Go server like any other process:
>
    curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: ${GITLAB_TOKEN}" localhost:21036/mr/info
<
==============================================================================
LUA API                                                         *gitlab.nvim.api*

gitlab.create_mr({opts}) ~

Starts the process of creating an MR for the currently checked out branch.
>lua
  require("gitlab").create_mr()
  require("gitlab").create_mr({ target = "main" })
  require("gitlab").create_mr({ target = "main", template_file = "my-template.md" })
  require("gitlab").create_mr({ title = "Fix bug XYZ", description = "Closes #123" })
<
    Parameters: ~
        • {opts}: (table|nil) Keyword arguments that can be used to skip
          certain steps in the MR creation process. `target` and
          `template_file` can also be configured via the `gitlab.setup()`
          function in the `settings.create_mr` field. If any field is missing,
          you will be prompted to select a value interactively:
            • {target}: (string) Name of the target branch.
            • {template_file}: (string) Name of file (relative to
              `.gitlab/merge_request_templates`) that will be used for the MR
              description. See also
              <https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/description_templates.html>.
            • {description}: (string) String used for the MR description.
              Takes precedence over the {template_file}, if both options are
              used.
            • {title}: (string) MR title.
            • {delete_branch}: (bool) If true, the source branch will be
              marked for deletion.
            • {squash}: (bool) If true, the commits will be marked for
              squashing.

After selecting all necessary details, you'll be presented with a confirmation
window. You can cycle through the individual fields with the keymaps defined
in `settings.popup.keymaps.next_field` and `settings.popup.keymaps.prev_field`.
Both keymaps accept a count, i.g., 2<Tab> goes to the 2nd next field.
In the "Delete source branch", "Squash commits", and "Target branch" fields,
you can use the `settings.popup.perform_linewise_action` keymap to either
toggle the Boolean value or to select a new target branch, respectively.
Use the `settings.popup.perform_action` keymap to POST the MR to Gitlab.

                                                                *gitlab.nvim.move_to_discussion_tree_from_diagnostic*

keybinding, by default |<leader>s|.

                                                                *gitlab.nvim.toggle_discussions*
gitlab.toggle_discussions() ~

Toggles visibility of the discussion tree.
>lua
  require("gitlab").toggle_discussions()

gitlab.data({resources}, {cb}) ~

The data function can be used to integrate `gitlab.nvim` with other plugins
and tooling, by fetching raw data about the current MR, including the summary
information (title, description, etc); reviewers, assignees, pipeline status.
>lua
  require("gitlab").data({
    { type = "info", refresh = false },
    { type = "user", refresh = false } }, function (data)
      vim.print("The info data is: ", data.info)
      vim.print("The user data is: ", data.user)
  end)

If the resources have not yet been fetched from Gitlab, this function will
perform API calls for them. Once the data has been fetched, the callback will
execute and passed the data as an argument.

    Parameters: ~
        • {resources}: (table) A list of {resource} blocks to fetch.
            • {resource}: (table) A resource to fetch, such as job
              information, etc. The resource is defined by its {type}:
                • {type}: (string) The type of resource, either:
                    • "user": Information about the currently authenticated
                      user.
                    • "labels": The labels available in the current project.
                    • "project_members": The list of current project members.
                    • "revisions": Revision information about the MR.
                    • "pipeline": Information about the current branch's
                      pipeline. Returns and object with `latest_pipeline` and
                      `jobs` as fields.
                    • "draft_notes": The current user's unpublished notes
                • {refresh}: (bool) Whether to re-fetch the data from Gitlab
                  or use the cached data locally, if available.
        • {cb}: (function) The callback function that runs after all of the
          resources have been fetched. Will be passed a table with the data,
          with each resource as a key-value pair, with the key being it's
          type.
