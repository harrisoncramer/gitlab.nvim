OVERVIEW                                                *gitlab.nvim.overview*

This Neovim plugin is designed to make it easy to review Gitlab MRs from within
the editor. This means you can do things like:

- Create, approve, and merge MRs for the current branch
- Read and edit an MR description
- Add or remove reviewers and assignees
- Resolve, reply to, and unresolve discussion threads
- Create, edit, delete, and reply to comments
- View and manage pipeline Jobs
- Upload files, jump to the browser, and a lot more!

REQUIREMENTS                                        *gitlab.nvim.requirements*

- Go >= v1.19


QUICK START                                          *gitlab.nvim.quick-start*

1. Install Go
2. Add configuration (see Installation section)
3. Checkout your feature branch: `git checkout feature-branch`
4. Open Neovim
5. Run `:lua require("gitlab").review()` to open the reviewer pane


INSTALLATION                                        *gitlab.nvim.installation*

With Lazy:

>lua
    return {
      "harrisoncramer/gitlab.nvim",
      dependencies = {
        "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
        "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
        "sindrets/diffview.nvim",
        "stevearc/dressing.nvim", -- Recommended but not required. Better UI for pickers.
        "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons" -- Recommended but not required. Icons in discussion tree.
      },
      enabled = true,
      build = function () require("gitlab.server").build(true) end, -- Builds the Go binary
      config = function()
        require("gitlab").setup()
      end,
    }
<

And with Packer:

>lua
    use {
      'harrisoncramer/gitlab.nvim',
      requires = {
        "MunifTanjim/nui.nvim",
        "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
        "sindrets/diffview.nvim",
        "stevearc/dressing.nvim", -- Recommended but not required. Better UI for pickers.
        "nvim-tree/nvim-web-devicons", -- Recommended but not required. Icons in discussion tree.
      },
      run = function() require("gitlab.server").build(true) end,
      config = function()
        require("gitlab").setup()
      end,
    }
<


CONNECTING TO GITLAB                        *gitlab.nvim.connecting-to-gitlab*

This plugin requires an auth token to connect to Gitlab. The token can be set
in the root directory of the project in a `.gitlab.nvim` environment file, or
can be set via a shell environment variable called `GITLAB_TOKEN` instead. If
both are present, the `.gitlab.nvim` file will take precedence.

Optionally provide a GITLAB_URL environment variable (or gitlab_url value in
the `.gitlab.nvim` file) to connect to a self-hosted Gitlab instance. This is
optional, use ONLY for self-hosted instances. Here’s what they’d look like
as environment variables:

>bash
    export GITLAB_TOKEN="your_gitlab_token"
    export GITLAB_URL="https://my-personal-gitlab-instance.com/"
<

And as a `.gitlab.nvim` file:

>
    auth_token=your_gitlab_token
    gitlab_url=https://my-personal-gitlab-instance.com/
<

The plugin will look for the `.gitlab.nvim` file in the root of the current
project by default. However, you may provide a custom path to the configuration
file via the `config_path` option. This must be an absolute path to the
directory that holds your `.gitlab.nvim` file.

The `connection_settings` block in the `state.lua` file will be used to
configure your connection to Gitlab.

CONFIGURING THE PLUGIN                    *gitlab.nvim.configuring-the-plugin*

Here is the default setup function. All of these values are optional, and if
you call this function with no values the defaults will be used:

USAGE                                                      *gitlab.nvim.usage*

First, check out the branch that you want to review locally.

>
    git checkout feature-branch
<

Then open Neovim. To begin, try running the `summary` command or the `review`
command.


THE SUMMARY VIEW                                *gitlab.nvim.the-summary-view*

The `summary` action will open the MR title and description.

>lua
    require("gitlab").summary()
<

After editing the description or title, you may save your changes via the
`settings.popup.perform_action` keybinding.

By default this plugin will also show additional metadata about the MR in a
separate pane underneath the description. This can be disabled, and these
fields can be reordered or removed. Please see the `settings.info` section of
the configuration.


REVIEWING AN MR                                  *gitlab.nvim.reviewing-an-mr*

The `review` action will open a diff of the changes. You can leave comments
using the `create_comment` action. In visual mode, add multiline comments with
the `create_multiline_comment` command, and add suggested changes with the
`create_comment_suggestion` command.

>lua
    require("gitlab").review()
    require("gitlab").create_comment()
    require("gitlab").create_multiline_comment()
    require("gitlab").create_comment_suggestion()
<

For suggesting changes you can use `create_comment_suggestion` in visual mode
which works similar to `create_multiline_comment` but prefills the comment
window with Gitlab’s suggest changes
<https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/reviews/suggestions.html>
code block with prefilled code from the visual selection.
Just like the summary, all the different kinds of comments are saved via the
`settings.popup.perform_action` keybinding.

BACKUP REGISTER                                  *gitlab.nvim.backup-register*

Sometimes, the action triggered by `settings.popup.perform_action` can fail.
To prevent losing your carefully crafted note/comment/suggestion you can set
`settings.popup.backup_register` to a writable register (see |registers|) to
which the contents of the popup window will be saved just before the action is
performed. A practical setting is `settings.popup.backup_register = "+"` which
saves to the system clipboard (see |quoteplus|). This lets you easily apply
the action on Gitlab in a browser, if it keeps failing in `gitlab.nvim`.

If you experience such problems, please first read the
|gitlab.nvim.troubleshooting| section. If it does not help, see if there are
any relevant known <https://github.com/harrisoncramer/gitlab.nvim/issues>. If
there are none, please open one and provide any error messages that
`gitlab.nvim` may be showing.

DISCUSSIONS AND NOTES                      *gitlab.nvim.discussions-and-notes*

Gitlab groups threads of comments together into "discussions."

To display all discussions for the current MR, use the `toggle_discussions`
action, which will show the discussions in a split window.

>lua
    require("gitlab").toggle_discussions()
<

You can jump to the comment’s location in the reviewer window by using the
`state.settings.discussion_tree.jump_to_reviewer` key, or to the actual file
with the `state.settings.discussion_tree.jump_to_file` key.

Within the discussion tree, you can delete/edit/reply to comments with the
`state.settings.discussion_tree.SOME_ACTION` keybindings.

If you’d like to create a note in an MR (like a comment, but not linked to a
specific line) use the `create_note` action. The same keybindings for
delete/edit/reply are available on the note tree.

>lua
    require("gitlab").create_note()
<

When the 'wrap' option is on, line wrapping can make the discussion tree
harder to read. You can use the 'breakindent' option to visually indent tree
nodes at the same level. If you don't want to set 'breakindent' globally, you
can set this only for the `gitlab` file type (the file type of discussions and
notes). One way of doing this is by creating a file called
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/nvim/after/ftplugin/gitlab.lua with the following contents:
>lua
    vim.o.breakindent = true
<

LABELS                                       *gitlab.nvim.labels*

You can add or remove labels from the current MR.
>lua
    require("gitlab").add_label()
    require("gitlab").delete_label()

These labels will be visible in the summary panel, as long as you provide the
"fields" string in your setup function under the `setting.info.fields` block.

SIGNS AND DIAGNOSTICS                      *gitlab.nvim.signs-and-diagnostics*

By default when reviewing files, you will see diagnostics for comments that 
have been added to a review. These are the default settings:
>lua
  discussion_signs = {
    enabled = true, -- Show diagnostics for gitlab comments in the reviewer
    skip_resolved_discussion = false, -- Show diagnostics for resolved discussions
    severity = vim.diagnostic.severity.INFO, -- ERROR, WARN, INFO, or HINT
    virtual_text = false, -- Whether to show the comment text inline as floating virtual text
    priority = 100, -- Higher will override LSP warnings, etc
    icons = {
      comment = "→|",
      range = " |",
    },
  },

When the cursor is on diagnostic line you can view discussion thread by using `vim.diagnostic.show()` 

You can also jump to discussion tree for the given comment:
>lua
    require("gitlab").move_to_discussion_tree_from_diagnostic()

You may skip resolved discussions by toggling `discussion_signs.skip_resolved_discussion`
in your setup function to true. By default, discussions from this plugin
are shown at the INFO severity level (see :h vim.diagnostic.severity).

EMOJIS                                       *gitlab.nvim.emojis*

You can add or remove emojis from a note or comment in the discussion tree.

To see who has reacted with an emoji, hover over the emoji. A popup will
appear with anyone who has responded with that emoji. You can only delete
emojis that you have responded with.


UPLOADING FILES                                  *gitlab.nvim.uploading-files*

To attach a file to an MR description, reply, comment, and so forth use the
`settings.popup.perform_linewise_action` keybinding when the popup is open.
This will open a picker that will look for files in the directory you specify
in the `settings.attachment_dir` folder (this must be an absolute path).

When you have picked the file, it will be added to the current buffer at the
current line.

Use the `settings.popup.perform_action` to send the changes to Gitlab.


MR APPROVALS                                        *gitlab.nvim.mr-approvals*

You can approve or revoke approval for an MR with the `approve` and `revoke`
actions respectively.

>lua
    require("gitlab").approve()
    require("gitlab").revoke()
<


MERGING AN MR                                      *gitlab.nvim.merging-an-mr*

The `merge` action will merge an MR. The MR must be in a "mergeable" state for
this command to work.

>lua
    require("gitlab").merge()
    require("gitlab").merge({ squash = false, delete_branch = false })
<

You can configure default behaviors via the setup function, values passed into
the `merge` action will override the defaults.

If you enable `squash` you will be prompted for a squash message. To use the
default message, leave the popup empty. Use the `settings.popup.perform_action`
to merge the MR with your message.


CREATING AN MR                                    *gitlab.nvim.creating-an-mr*

To create an MR for the current branch, make sure you have the branch checked
out. Then, use the `create_mr` action. See `:h gitlab.nvim.create_mr` for more
help on this function
>lua
    require("gitlab").create_mr()
    require("gitlab").create_mr({ target = "main" })
    require("gitlab").create_mr({ target = "main", template_file = "my-template.md" })
<
PIPELINES                                              *gitlab.nvim.pipelines*

You can view the status of the pipeline for the current MR with the `pipeline`
action.
>lua
    require("gitlab").pipeline()
<
To re-trigger failed jobs in the pipeline manually, use the
`settings.popup.perform_action` keybinding. To open the log trace of a job in a
new Neovim buffer, use your `settings.popup.perform_linewise_action`
keybinding.

REVIEWERS AND ASSIGNEES                  *gitlab.nvim.reviewers-and-assignees*

The `add_reviewer` and `delete_reviewer` actions, as well as the `add_assignee`
and `delete_assignee` functions, will let you choose from a list of users who
are available in the current project:

>lua
    require("gitlab").add_reviewer()
    require("gitlab").delete_reviewer()
    require("gitlab").add_assignee()
    require("gitlab").delete_assignee()
<

These actions use Neovim’s built in picker, which is much nicer if you
install dressing. If you use Dressing, please enable it:

>lua
    require("dressing").setup({
        input = {
            enabled = true
        }
    })
<


RESTARTING OR SHUTTING DOWN          *gitlab.nvim.restarting-or-shutting-down*

The `gitlab.nvim` server will shut down automatically when you exit Neovim.
However, if you would like to manage this yourself (for instance, restart the
server when you check out a new branch) you may do so via the `restart`
command, or `shutdown` commands, which both accept callbacks.

>lua
    require("gitlab.server").restart()
<

For instance you could set up the following keybinding to close and reopen the
reviewer when checking out a new branch:

>lua
    local gitlab = require("gitlab")
    vim.keymap.set("n", "glB", function ()
        require("gitlab.server").restart(function ()
            vim.cmd.tabclose()
            gitlab.review() -- Reopen the reviewer after the server restarts
        end)
    end)
<


KEYBINDINGS                                          *gitlab.nvim.keybindings*

The plugin does not set up any keybindings outside of the special buffers it
creates, you need to set them up yourself. Here’s what I’m using (note that
the `<leader>` prefix is not necessary, as `gl` does not have a special meaning
in normal mode):

>lua
    local gitlab = require("gitlab")

TROUBLESHOOTING                                  *gitlab.nvim.troubleshooting*

**To check that the current settings of the plugin are configured correctly,
please run: :lua require("gitlab").print_settings()**

This plugin uses a Go server to reach out to Gitlab. It’s possible that
something is going wrong when starting that server or connecting with Gitlab.
The Go server runs outside of Neovim, and can be interacted with directly in
order to troubleshoot. To start the server, check out your feature branch and
run these commands:

>lua
    :lua require("gitlab.server").build(true)
    :lua require("gitlab.server").start(function() print("Server started") end)
<

The easiest way to debug what’s going wrong is to turn on the `debug` options
in your setup function. This will allow you to see requests leaving the Go
server, and the responses coming back from Gitlab. Once the server is running,
you can also interact with the Go server like any other process:

>
    curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: ${GITLAB_TOKEN}" localhost:21036/mr/info
<
==============================================================================
Lua API							 	*gitlab.nvim.api*

setup()								*gitlab.nvim.setup*

Call this first to initialize the plugin. With no arguments, it will use the
default arguments outlined under "Configuring the Plugin".
>lua
  require("gitlab").setup()

  require("gitlab").setup({ port = 8392 })

  require("gitlab").setup({ discussion_tree = { blacklist = { "some_bot"} } })

review()							*gitlab.nvim.review*

Opens the reviewer pane. Can be used from anywhere within Neovim after the
plugin is loaded. If run twice, will open a second reviewer pane.
>lua
  require("gitlab").review()

summary()							*gitlab.nvim.summary*

Opens the summary window with information about the current MR, such as the
description, the author, and the title. Can be configured via the `info` field
in the setup call.
>lua
  require("gitlab").summary()

The summary can be edited. Once you have made changes, send them to Gitlab via
the `settings.popup.perform_action` keybinding.

approve()							*gitlab.nvim.approve*

Approves the current MR. Will error if the current user does not have
permission.
>lua
  require("gitlab").approve()

gitlab.revoke()							*gitlab.nvim.revoke*

Revokes approval for the current MR. Will error if the current user does not
have permission or has not previously approved the MR.
>lua
  require("gitlab").approve()

gitlab.create_comment()						*gitlab.nvim.create_comment*

Opens a popup to create a comment on the current line. Must be called when focused on the
reviewer pane (see the gitlab.nvim.review command), otherwise it will error.
>lua
  require("gitlab").comment()

After the comment is typed, submit it to Gitlab via the |settings.popup.perform_action|
keybinding, by default `<leader>l`

create_multiline_comment()					*gitlab.nvim.create_multiline_comment*

Opens a popup to create a multi-line comment. May only be called in visual
mode, and will use the currently selected lines.
>lua
  require("gitlab").create_multiline_comment()

After the comment is typed, submit it to Gitlab via the |settings.popup.perform_linewise_action|
keybinding, by default `<leader>l`.

create_comment_suggestion()					*gitlab.nvim.create_comment_suggestion*

Opens a popup to create a comment suggestion (aka a comment that makes a committable
change suggestion to the currently selected lines).
>lua
  require("gitlab").create_multiline_comment()

After the comment is typed, submit it to Gitlab via the |settings.popup.perform_linewise_action|
keybinding, by default |<leader>l|

create_mr({opts})						*gitlab.nvim.create_mr*

Starts the process of creating an MR for the currently checked out branch.
>lua
    require("gitlab").create_mr()
    require("gitlab").create_mr({ target = "main" })
    require("gitlab").create_mr({ target = "main", template_file = "my-template.md" })

Parameters:
  • {opts}         Lua table that can be used to skip certain steps in the MR
  creation process. If `target` is provided, you will not be prompted for one.
  If a template_file is provided, it will be used automatically. Must be
  located in `.gitlab/merge_request_templates`

  These values can also be configured via the `gitlab.setup` function

gitlab.move_to_discussion_tree_from_diagnostic()		*gitlab.nvim.move_to_discussion_tree_from_diagnostic*

When hovering over a diagnostic in the reviewer pane, jumps to the relevant
node in the discussion tree.
>lua
  require("gitlab").move_to_discussion_tree_from_diagnostic()

If there are no diagnostics for the current line, shows a warning message.

gitlab.create_note()						*gitlab.nvim.create_note*

Opens a popup to create a note. Notes are like comments except they are not
tied to specific changes in an MR.
>lua
  require("gitlab").create_note()

After the comment is typed, submit it to Gitlab via the |settings.popup.perform_action|
keybinding, by default |<leader>l|

gitlab.toggle_discussions()					*gitlab.nvim.toggle_discussions*

Toggles visibility of the discussion tree.
>lua
  require("gitlab").toggle_discussions()

Once the discussion tree is open, a number of different keybindings are available
for interacting with different discussions. Please see the `settings.discussion_tree`
section of the setup call for more information about different keybindings.

gitlab.add_assignee()						*gitlab.nvim.add_assignee*

Opens up a select menu for choosing an assignee for the current merge request.
>lua
  require("gitlab").add_assignee()

gitlab.delete_assignee()					*gitlab.nvim.delete_assignee*

Opens up a select menu for removing an existing assignee for the current merge request.
>lua
  require("gitlab").delete_assignee()

gitlab.add_reviewer()						*gitlab.nvim.add_reviewer*

Opens up a select menu for adding a reviewer for the current merge request.
>lua
  require("gitlab").add_reviewer()

gitlab.add_label()						*gitlab.nvim.add_label*

Opens up a select menu for adding a label to the current merge request.
>lua
  require("gitlab").add_label()

>lua
  require("gitlab").delete_reviewer()

gitlab.pipeline()						*gitlab.nvim.pipeline*

Opens up a popup with information about the pipeline for the current merge request.
>lua
  require("gitlab").pipeline()

To re-trigger failed jobs in the pipeline manually, use the `settings.popup.perform_action` keybinding.
To open the log trace of a job in a new Neovim buffer, use your `settings.popup.perform_linewise_action`
keybinding.

gitlab.open_in_browser()					*gitlab.nvim.open_in_browser*

Opens the current MR in your default web browser.
>lua
  require("gitlab").open_in_browser()

gitlab.merge()							*gitlab.nvim.merge*

Merges the merge request into the target branch
>lua
  require("gitlab").merge()

gitlab.data({ opts }, cb)					*gitlab.nvim.data*

The data function can be used to integrate `gitlab.nvim` with other plugins and tooling, by fetching 
raw data about the current MR, including the summary information (title, description, etc); 
reviewers, assignees, pipeline status.
>lua
  require("gitlab").data({ refresh = false, resources = { revisions } }, function (data)
      vim.print("The pipeline data is: ", data.pipeline)
  end)

If the resources have not yet been fetched from Gitlab, this function will
perform API calls for them. Once the data has been fetched, the callback will
execute and passed the data as an argument.

Parameters: ~
  • {opts} (table) Keyword arguments that can be used to specify how the 
      data API works. which
  • {opts.refresh} (bool) Whether to re-call Gitlab API every time, or to use
      the data already cached in the plugin from the last API call
  • {opts.resources} (table) Specify which resources to fetch. All resources are 
      false by default, except for "info" which will always be fetched:
      • `info`: (true) Information about the current MR, always present
      • `user`: (bool) Information about the currently authenticated user
      • `labels`: (bool) The labels available in the current project
      • `project_members`: (bool) The list of current project members
      • `revisions`: (bool) Revision information about the MR
      • `reviewers`: (bool) All reviewers in the current project
      • `assignees`: (bool) All assignees in the current project
  • {cb} (function) The callback function that runs after all of the
      resources have been fetched. Will be passed a table with the data.
